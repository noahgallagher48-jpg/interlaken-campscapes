"""Miller's production spec, as data rather than as constants buried in a builder.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Until now the press spec lived as PAGE_IN = (12, 8) in two
separate builders (kingswood/hub/build_book.py and ramah/build_ramah_book.py),
with no bleed, no safe area, and no validation. That produced a file that
happened to print once. This makes the spec explicit, shared, and checkable, so
a layout either passes or names the reason it cannot ship.

SOURCED 2026-08-26 from millerslab.com. Every number carries its confidence,
because a spec that hides its uncertainty is worse than no spec.

CONFIRMED by Miller's published material:
- Signature Books are layflat, handcrafted, on Matte press, Pearl press, or
  Deep Matte photographic paper.
- Design templates carry 1/8 inch bleed on all sides.
- Hardcover (Custom Image, Bonded Leather, Brushed EcoLeather, Faux Leather,
  Linen, Velvet): 5 spread minimum, 50 spread maximum. 1 spread = 2 sides.
- Softcover: 10 spread minimum, 25 spread maximum.
- Keep important elements 3/8 to 1/2 inch off the edge of the file.
- Files sized to the largest size ordered at 250 DPI (stated for Signature
  Albums; we output 300, which is above the bar and safe either way).

PROVEN in our own work:
- 12x8 hardcover linen, Signature Book, $105.50 on press. Ramah 2026. That is
  the only configuration this studio has taken end to end.

CONFIRMED 2026-08-27 from Miller's own PDFs, not their web pages:
- instructions.pdf (templates): "All templates contain 1/8" bleed on all sides."
  Templates are layered Photoshop PSDs. This is the bleed already built in.
- SIGNATURE ALBUM.pdf (the order form) carries a Miller's Drop Box link and the
  instruction "Miller's Transfer Link to zip: right click on folder, Send to>
  Compressed folder", i.e. work is delivered as a ZIPPED FOLDER through
  transfer.millerslab.com, alongside the filled order form.
- That same form specifies cover treatment as FOIL and DEBOSSED TEXT by
  position: cover top / mid / bottom and back top / mid / bottom. So a LINEN
  cover takes typeset text on the order form and NO supplied artwork. The photo
  cover build_book.py makes is for a Custom Image cover, a different product.
  The linen path is the one this studio has actually printed, and it needs no
  cover file and no spine width at all.

NOT CONFIRMED, and flagged wherever it matters:
- Whether Signature Books are submitted as single sides or as composed layflat
  spreads. The layflat construction and Miller's own "1 spread = 2 sides"
  counting both point at spreads, but their published pages did not state the
  submission unit outright. build_book.py can emit either; confirm at order
  time and set SUBMIT_UNIT. Do not assume.
- Spine width for a Custom Image (photo wrap) cover. It is a function of page
  count and paper stock and Miller's publishes it per template. SPINE_IN below
  is a placeholder that MUST be replaced with the number from the actual
  template before a wrap cover is ordered. A front-only cover avoids the
  question entirely.
- The full size list. 12x8 is ours and is verified; the others here are not
  and are marked.

# --- trim sizes, inches (w, h) -------------------------------------------
# The twelve sizes come from Codex's research pass, 2026-08-27, sourced to
# Miller's live product page AND their SIGNATURE BOOK 2026 order form, which
# agree. Logged in COLLAB_LOG. I independently verified that PDF exists and
# carries the zip/transfer route and the art_info address; I could NOT verify
# the size list from it myself, because the form is field-labelled and my text
# extraction returns fragments. So the list is Codex-sourced, not Claude-checked,
# and only 12x8 carries verified=True, which still means only one thing: this
# studio has ordered it and held the result.
# Codex also flagged a 15x10 debossing row on page 2 of that form which appears
# on no current size list. Treated as stale boilerplate and deliberately absent.
